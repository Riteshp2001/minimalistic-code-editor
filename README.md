## Features

-   **Simplicity**: A minimalistic interface with a focus on your code and minimal distractions.
-   **Syntax Highlighting**: Supports syntax highlighting for popular programming languages.
-   **Code Folding**: Easily collapse and expand sections of code for improved readability.
-   **Basic Code Editing**: Features include code autocompletion and customizable themes.
-   **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Riteshp2001/minimilistic-code-editor.git
    ```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Future Enhancements

Consider these exciting features for future improvements to your Minimalistic Code Editor:

### 1. File Navigation

Simplify project management by adding a built-in file explorer. Users can navigate their project's files and directories easily, enhancing productivity and code organization.

### 2. Code Splitting

Improve performance by implementing code splitting. Load only the necessary components, reducing initial load times and providing a smoother user experience.

### 3. Intelligent Code Suggestions

Enhance productivity by incorporating AI-powered code suggestions. Help users write code faster and with fewer errors, making their coding experience even more efficient.

### 4. Version Control Integration

Streamline the development process by integrating Git for version control directly within the editor. This feature allows users to manage their code changes seamlessly.

### 5. Extensions and Plugins

Empower users to extend the editor's functionality with custom extensions or plugins. This flexibility lets developers tailor the editor to their specific needs and workflows.

### 6. Offline Mode

Enable offline usage with service worker support. Users can continue to work on their projects even when they're not connected to the internet, improving accessibility and reliability.

### 7. User Themes

Give users the ability to create and share custom themes. Personalization is key, and this feature allows users to adapt the editor's appearance to their preferences.

These enhancements will make your Minimalistic Code Editor more versatile and appealing to a broader audience of developers.
